INSTALLATION
############

For Mac and Linux:

1) Dowload the PRIME1.0.zip file and move it to a directory
of your choice, where you have writing permissions.

2) Unzip the PRIME1.0.zip package.

3) Open the PRIME file and replace lib_path by the
path to the PRIME1.0/lib directory where you have installed the script

4) To run it from anywhere on your computer, add the PRIME1.0 directory to your path.

5) PRIME requires MixMHCpred v2.0.2 or above to be installed on your computer (https://github.com/GfellerLab/MixMHCpred) and be in your PATH (if not in your PATH, you can use the '-mix PATH_TO_MIXMHCPRED' command line option).

6) To test your installation, make sure you are in the PRIME1.0/ directory and run the command (should not take more than a few seconds):

   ./PRIME -i test/test.txt -o test/out.txt -a A0201,A0101

The output file test/out.txt should be exatly the same as test/out_compare.txt

Command:
PRIME -i input_file -o output_dir -a allele1,allele2

input_file:
File listing all the peptides. Ideally a fasta file, but text files
are supported and lines starting with ">" are skipped.
All peptides should between 8 and 14-mers.

allele:
HLA-I allele. Use the simple nomenclature like A0101.
A01:01, A*01:01 or HLA-A*01:01 are also supported, but not
recommanded. If you want to make predictions with multiple
alleles, list the different alleles separated by a single comma ","
(e.g. -a A0101,A2501,B0801,B1801).

output_file:
The name of the output file.

Parameters:

-mix: Give the path to MixMHCpred. Version 2.0.2 or above is required
-predBinding: Decide whether to use MixMHCpred or NetMHCpan (default is MixMHCpred). Importantly, PRIME was trained using MixMHCpred. Although the %rank of NetMHCpan are quite similar to those of MixMHCpred and span the sam range of values, PRIME predictions may be less accurate when using NetMHCpan. Using NetMHCpan also implies that NetMHCpan4.0 is installed in your computer and available in your path. NetMHCpan is required for predictions in non-human MHC alleles.

Output
########

PRIME.txt provides the output of the immunogenicity predictions.
Column 1: Peptide sequence
Column 2: Lowest %Rank for PRIME score across the different alleles
Column 3: PRIME Score corresponding to alleles with the lowest %Rank
Column 4: Predicted binding score (MixMHCpred %Rank)
Column 5: Best allele
Additional columns: %Rank, scores and MixMHCpred %Rank for each allele.

As in NetMHCpan, %Rank (Column 2) indicates the percentile of randomly generated peptides that would have a score higher or equal.
