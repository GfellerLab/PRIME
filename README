############
INSTALLATION
############

For Mac and Linux:

1) Dowload the PRIME2.0.zip file and move it to a directory
of your choice, where you have writing permissions.

2) Unzip the PRIME2.0.zip package.

3) Open the PRIME file and replace lib_path by the
path to the PRIME2.0/lib directory where you have installed the script

4) To run it from anywhere on your computer, add the PRIME2.0 directory to your path.

5) PRIME requires MixMHCpred v2.2 or above to be installed on your computer (https://github.com/GfellerLab/MixMHCpred) and be in your PATH (if not in your PATH, you can use the '-mix PATH_TO_MIXMHCPRED' command line option).

6) To test your installation, make sure you are in the PRIME2.0/ directory and run the command (should not take more than a few seconds):

   ./PRIME -i test/test.txt -o test/out.txt -a A0201,A0101

Apart from specific paths, the output file test/out.txt should be the same as test/out_compare.txt

Command:
PRIME -i input_file -o output_dir -a allele1,allele2

-i input_file:
File listing all the peptides. Ideally a text file, but fasta files
are supported and lines starting with ">" are skipped. Do NOT use filenames with special characters like '*' (e.g., "HLA-A*02:01.txt").
All peptides should between 8 and 14-mers. Depending on your memory, you may have issues if the number of peptides is too large (e.g., > 1'000'000).

-a allele:
HLA-I allele. Use the simple nomenclature like A0101.
A01:01, HLA-A01:01 or HLA-A*01:01 are also supported, but not
recommanded. If you want to make predictions with multiple
alleles, list the different alleles separated by a single comma ","
(e.g. -a A0101,A2501,B0801,B1801).

-o output_file:
The name of the output file. Do NOT use filenames with special characters like '*' (e.g., "HLA-A*02:01.txt").

Optional parameters:

-mix: Give the full path of MixMHCpred executable. Version 2.2 or above is required

########
Output
########

PRIME.txt provides the output of the immunogenicity predictions.
Column 1: Peptide sequence
Column 2: Lowest %Rank for PRIME score across the different alleles
Column 3: PRIME Score corresponding to alleles with the lowest %Rank
Column 4: Predicted binding score (MixMHCpred %Rank)
Column 5: Best allele (based on the lowest PRIME %rank).
Additional columns: %Rank, scores and MixMHCpred %Rank for each allele.

%Rank (Column 2) indicates the fraction of random peptides from the human proteome (length 8 to 14) that would have a score higher or equal.
